/**
 * Politicians & parties API — backed by the backend's GET /politicians and
 * GET /parties (see indian-rajniti-backend/src/controllers/politicians/
 * politicians.controller.js). Real, WebSearch-verified biographical data
 * (education, career timeline, current status) and real photos, not the
 * dummy data this file used to return. Every exported function keeps its
 * original name/shape so no consuming component needed to change.
